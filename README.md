# WindowsRegistryEdits
This is where all Windows Registry Hacks I make or find end up.

Do note that some edits will require a restart of the computer or Windows Explorer. I will point out the requirements for each edit to take effect:

Show All Icons - On/Off: Restart Windows Explorer

Desktop Icons - Small/Medium/Large: Restart Windows Explorer
